# PDF-Splitter
Split PDF files into separate pages 


Replace /path/to/your/target_directory with the path of the directory where you want to consolidate all the PDFs.

This script will find all PDFs in the root directory and its subdirectories. For each PDF found, it will move it to the target directory. If a file with the same name already exists in the target directory, it will append a number to the file name to make it unique.

Important: Always back up important data before running scripts that modify file locations.
